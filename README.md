# Image-Stitching
->Code for stitching of more than 2 images at a time (even number of images) using SIFT and knn Matcher
->Once row-wise stitched images are obtained one needs to perform a rotation function (90 degrees clockwise) for stitching row-wise images vertically.
->After the stitching is performed then the resultant image is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degress to get the original input image.
